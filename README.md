# MapMyWorld
Project 2 For Data Analyis

How can Python enhance your life?  Does Javascript really lead to a greater income?  If you have the right map, it can!  We are proposing to use a Python/Flask database of census data and pulling data from Google API and Yelp data to find out where a person can find happiness.

We will use dropdowns to give you options about what you are looking for in a neighborhood and either recommend a more suitable location or compare to an ideal location of those characteristics.  

Some of the questions:  Do you eat out a lot?  Do you cook at home?  Do you go to the gym?  Based on these questions, we can show restaurants vs. grocery stores.  Parks vs. gyms...

We will put together some kind of score that will be graphed or put into a gauge comparing your location with a static ‘ideal’ location.
